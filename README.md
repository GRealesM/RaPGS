**A *rápido* and lightweight method to compute Polygenic Risk Scores.**

Last update: 2020-08-03

This package allows to quickly (*rápido* is Spanish for "fast") compute polygenic scores (PGS) from case-control or quantitative trait GWAS summary statistic datasets, without the need of an external validation dataset.
